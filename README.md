# 🚗 Smart Parking System – IoT Project

A smart parking system designed and built by **high school students** under the supervision of **Teacher Safia Mohammed Al-Qarni** for the *Internet of Things (IoT)* course.  

The system monitors **available parking spaces** in real-time and displays the status on an **LCD screen**, helping drivers find open spots efficiently and reducing traffic congestion.  
It demonstrates practical IoT applications using sensors and Arduino technology.  

🎥 *A demo video is included in this repository — the teacher is very proud of her students and their creativity!* 💚

## ⚙️ Components
| Component | Function |
|------------|-----------|
| Arduino UNO | Main microcontroller |
| Ultrasonic Sensor | Detects presence of vehicles in parking spots |
| LCD Display | Shows real-time status of each parking spot |
| LEDs (Red / Green) | Indicates whether a parking spot is available or occupied |
| Breadboard & Jumper Wires | Circuit connections |

---

## 💡 How It Works
1. Ultrasonic sensors continuously check each parking spot.  
2. Arduino processes the data and updates the **LCD display** and LED indicators.  
3. Green LED → spot is available; Red LED → spot is occupied.  
4. The LCD screen shows the **status of each spot** in real-time.

## 💻 Code File
All Arduino logic is included in **SmartParking.ino**.  
The code can be simulated using **Tinkercad Circuits** or implemented on a physical prototype.
